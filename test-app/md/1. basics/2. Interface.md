### Interface

The framework exposes different agents that help with maintaining a documentation.

#### Pull Agent

Pull agents periodically read from a source to apply possible changes to the documentation contents in order to trigger a rendering.

#### Push Agent

Push agents wait for a source to notify changes to the documentation contents in order to trigger a rendering.
